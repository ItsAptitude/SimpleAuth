# Notes:

This was orignally created by Prab: https://github.com/NotPrab/LoginSystem
However, that was garbage so i improved it.

- Better HWID Method (Spoofer Support)
- Does Not Use Default Proxy Anymore (HTTP Debugger Protection)
- Removed Free Login
- General Code Improvements

## Disclaimer: 
I don't recommend using this for your applications, this was just created for fun.
