After you've made the pastebin, press raw and copy the link to the code.


Note:

This was orignally created by Prab: https://github.com/NotPrab/LoginSystem
However, that was garbage so i improved it.

- Now uses better HWID grabbing method that supports spoofers
- Doesn't use default proxy anymore (HTTP Debugger Protection)
- Only one login

Disclaimer: I don't recommend using this for your applications, this was just created for fun.
